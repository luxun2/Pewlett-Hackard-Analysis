# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of Project
###### Explain the purpose of this analysis

In this analysis we are assisting a company called Pewlett_Hackard to understand how much a wave of retiring baby boomers will impact the company. We organize the people who are retiring by title and then see which employees are eligible for a mentorship program to help fill the ranks of those that are leaving. 

## Results
###### Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

* There's roughly 70,000 senior level employees ready to retire. 

* There is a good amount of people who are younger but still experienced able to mentor the up and coming work force. 

* Most of the retiring workforce are engineers

###### Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

This script can be re-used for other state elections based on some small modifications in that the incoming csv or input data will have be in a similar format. Instead of writing the results to a text file they can instead be emailed or put in a database for better presentation.

# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of Project
###### Explain the purpose of this analysis

In this analysis we are assisting a company called Pewlett_Hackard to understand how much a wave of retiring baby boomers will impact the company. We organize the people who are retiring by title and then see which employees are eligible for a mentorship program to help fill the ranks of those that are leaving. Uses SQL statements like GROUPBY and JOINs to filter csv data and create new tables with the necessary info.

## Results
###### Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

* There's roughly 70,000 senior level employees ready to retire. 

* There is a good amount of people who are younger but still experienced able to mentor the up and coming work force. 

* Most of the retiring workforce are engineers

* There are only 7 unique titles in the company

## Election-Audit Summary: 
###### Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami.

"How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 72,458 
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Yes

Overall it the silver tsunami seems quite substancial and more hiring and mentoring must be done to improve Pewlett Hackard's human capital. 
Two additional queries that could be useful is figuring out which departments will be effected the most and to review current salaries and retirement packages to retain employees or reduce cost on the company.
